   spring.datasource.username=your_username  
   spring.datasource.password=your_password  
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

## API Endpoints

### User
- POST /api/users/register → Register user  
- POST /api/users/login → Login user  

### Finance
- GET /api/finance/dashboard/full?email={email}  
- POST /api/finance/inflow  
- POST /api/finance/outflow  
- DELETE /api/finance/inflow/{id}?email={email}  
- DELETE /api/finance/outflow/{id}?email={email}

- Email is stored on frontend (localStorage)  
- Dashboard fetches user-specific data using email  
- Backend validates user before performing actions  
- Transactions dynamically update UI  

---

## Security Notes

- Spring Security is configured for API protection  
- CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication
